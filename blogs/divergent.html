            Divergent is the 1st book in the famous Divergent series by Veronica Roth. The story takes place in a closed and crumbling city with a rather unique setting. The city is divided into five factions on the basis of specific traits. The factions are Abnegation (selfless), Erudite (intellectual), Dauntless (brave), Candor (honest), and Amity (peaceful). Each faction has a specific role in the functioning of the city.

            The story surrounds a sixteen years old Abnegation girl called Beatrice Prior who later changed her name to Tris. She is faced with a once in a lifetime choice to her faction. Her aptitude test gives her a unique result. Instead of one faction she is suitable for three factions. Unable to conform to the humble ideals of Abnegation, her home faction, she joins Dauntless, where she struggles to be both brave and unselfish. In the story the author emphasizes on her feelings and the change in life. From a peaceful life to one with heavy struggle for survival. She gets caught in the struggle for power and control as erudite hunts down divergents.  She along with four fights all dangers to protect her life and that of her friends and family.

            The other important characters include four who is later revealed to be Tobias Eaton, an abnegation transfer, son of Marcus Eaton. Tobias is a trainer of Dauntless initiates who transferred into the faction. His moderate approach often puts him at odds with Eric, the ruthless head of Dauntless training. He was serious and brave, initiates often found him frightening. Jeanine Matthews is the antagonist of the story. The person with the highest IQ in Erudite, and the faction’s leader and representative on the city’s political council. She masterminds a war against Abnegation and develops a serum to control the Dauntless. Eric was A Dauntless leader who transferred from Erudite and is now in charge of training Dauntless initiates, which he does with excessive brutality. He came in second to Four during their initiation several years ago and still harbours a grudge against him.Al is Tris’s friend, a Dauntless initiate who transferred from Candor. Despite his physical size and strength, he’s unwilling to hurt others and performs poorly throughout initiation. Out of jealousy towards Tris, he helps Peter and Drew  to attack Tris. Peter is A Candor transfer and Tris’s main enemy in Dauntless. Boastful, intelligent, and cruel, he’s willing to do anything to place first in the rankings, including attack fellow trainees. Christina is Tris’s best friend in Dauntless, a bold and funny initiate who transferred from Candor. She helps Tris relax and open up more than she was able to in Abnegation. Will is a sarcastic but kind Dauntless initiate who transferred from Erudite. He’s conflicted about the tensions between Erudite and Abnegation and has several political discussions with Tris. Tori is Tris’s aptitude test administrator and a member of Dauntless who works in the tattoo parlour. After learning Tris is Divergent, Tori warns that her life is in danger and tries to help her stay safe. Tori also secretly plans for revenge against dauntless leaders for the death of divergent brother. Marcus is Tobias’s father and a leader on the Abnegation political council. Although he acts virtuously, his behaviour is calculating and deceptive. His physical abuse caused Tobias to leave Abnegation and join Dauntless. Edward is an Erudite transfer to Dauntless who has studied hand-to-hand combat since childhood. After he beats Peter in the stage one rankings, Peter stabs him in the eye with a butter knife. Forcing him to leave dauntless. Caleb Prior is Tris’s brother, who is also sixteen.

A model Abnegation member who works at a volunteer agency, she surprises Tris by revealing her Dauntless background. Andrew Prior is Tris’s father and a member of the political council that rules the city. He is devoted to Abnegation and feels betrayed when both his children leave for new factions. Uriah is a friendly Dauntless-born initiate whose older brother, Zeke, gives him inside information about training.

            Erudite, under the leadership of Jeanine Matthews, uses a stimulation serum to mind-control dauntless and wage a war against abnegation, the city leaders.

In this struggle, Tris ends up shooting her mind-controlled friend Will, who dies. But manages to put an end to the stimulation and move to Amity headquarters to seek safety.
